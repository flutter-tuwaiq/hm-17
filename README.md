# Sign Up and Login Screens with Password Visibility and Token Key Storage

## The idea is to:

1. Create a Flutter app that includes a Sign Up/Login screens.
2. Implement the functionality to show/hide the password using an eye icon.
3. Use the `projects_final` API project for authentication.
4. Save a token key in storage when the app is built again.
